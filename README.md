# 4-Way-Traffic-Light-Controller-using-FSM-Verilog-
A synthesizable 4-way traffic light controller designed using a finite state machine in Verilog. The design uses a single shared timer, explicit phase rotation, and well-defined GREEN–YELLOW–RED timing. Verified through waveform-based simulation on EDA Playground.
